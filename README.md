# ft_printf - A Custom printf Implementation

## About the Project

The ft_printf project is an implementation of the `printf` function, which is a crucial part of the standard C library. This custom `ft_printf` function mimics the original `printf` and is designed to handle various format specifiers, making it a versatile tool for formatting and displaying data. By successfully completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of variable arguments and function parameters in C/C++.

## Features
